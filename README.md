## License

No license is needed for application evaluation - it will work in demo mode (with some restrictions).

**KlvInjector** is a node locked software, so you have to get a license (after purchasing the SW) in order to lift demo restrictions. Please install it and fill an [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_XW6bDsFce1G1cpds4gMQNlwNax0CvkWzcMbscxZ5rLaIbA/viewform), providing the ***Node Info*** string (IMPORTANT!!!) for the target machine.  
***Node Info*** string can be found at ***Options->License***, as shown below.

Copy and paste the Node Info string into the online form, or email it to support@impleotv.com.  
If your computer is offline or you're unable to copy the Node Info text, take a photo of the license page with the QR code clearly visible and send it to us instead.  
You'll receive a license file (or a license file and a key, for legacy versions).  
To complete activation, select the license file on the Options -> License page. If a key is provided, enter it as well.
